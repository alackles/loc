## Contribution PAQ (Possibly Asked Questions)

### Are you looking for more contributers?

**Yes!** We are looking for any and all participants interested in lending their expertise to this project. Genetic complexity and societal oppression is a broad topic; we are of course interested in perspectives of biologists and sociologists, but interested contributors of any background are invited to participate.

We also welcome contributors **without an academic background** and/or **without current affiliation**. See section below for ideas how to contribute to the paper in this capacity!

### What do I have to do to be an author on the paper?

Under our current authorship guidelines, authors must at least:

- **Contribute** at least one resource to the resource pool. Such contributions may be: a citation to a scientific or historical paper; relevant firsthand knowledge as a marginalized person; synthesis of existing contributions.
- **Review** at least part of a manuscript draft or drafts. Review involves reading at least one section of a draft and offering comments/critiques/praise on the _content_ and _structure_ of the section.
- **Approve** of the final manuscript before it is sent to a venue for publication.

Of course, additional contributions are welcome, such as **writing** a draft/section of a draft or **editing** on strictly grammatical terms, but these contributions are neither necessary nor sufficient for authorship.

These guidelines are subject to change at the discretion of the group, but will not become _more_ restrictive. That is, options for contribution or review may be added, but authors will never become ineligible for authorship due to changing guidelines.


### What will the authorship order be? 

- As lead coordinator of the project, Acacia Ackles will be first author.
- Authors who contribute substantially to the **writing** of the manuscript and/or **synthesis** of materials will be listed next, with order guided by [Liboiron et al. 2017][liboiron]. What constitutes "substantial contribution" will be decided at the group level.
- All other authors will be listed alphabetically by surname.
