This is a large, open collaboration of cross-disciplinary authors looking to **critically examine concepts of genetic complexity** through an anti-oppressive lens. 

Our current goal is to publish a paper which will examinie the origins of genetic complexity, make evidence-based suggestions for future researchers, and highlight our contemporaries doing this work.
